# Weather CLI Tool

## Overview

The Weather CLI Tool is a command-line application that reads weather data from a JSON file, calculates the average temperature for different cities, and allows users to interact with the data through various commands. This tool is designed to provide quick and easy access to weather information directly from the terminal.

## Project Background

This project was developed during my first hackathon organized by GamutX, where Iâ€™m currently on an exciting journey to enhance my skills. Participating in this event was a remarkable experience. Working on this tool provided valuable learning experiences in software development and collaboration.

## Features

- Display average temperatures for all cities.
- Get the average temperature for a specific city.
- Convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- List all available cities in the dataset.
- Help command for usage instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7.9 or higher installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Run the `weather_cli.bat` file.
3. Use the `--help` command to learn how to interact with the tool.
